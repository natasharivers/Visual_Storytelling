STEPS TO CREATE YOUR CHARTS:

1. PREPARE to create
- Concepts: 
    - clean your area, 
    - get organized
- Headspace: 
    -keep your thinking broad
    - understand your data but don't use it yet
- Artifacts:
    - come out of this stage with notes about audience, setting, types of visuals
    - document your decision honing in your Big Idea
__________________________________________________________________

Ask yourself:
1. which story framework fits my project
2. who's your audience
3. settings and deliverables (turn in)
4. what did I learn from brainstormming
5. what visuals align with my goals

Storytelling in 3 steps:
1. Setup
2. Conflict
3. Resolution
__________________________________________________________________

Know your Audience:
1. who are they
    -use correct verbeage: coorelation (DS) vs relationship (others)
2. have they every seen this kind of chart before
    - not everyone knows how to read a scatterchart
    - people should not have to learn how to use your kind of chart
3. are they familiar
    - educate your audience about your topic
4. what do they already know
5. who else might see it

BIG IDEA (controlling idea/ thesis statement/ takeaway):
    Must haves:
        1. convey your unique perspective
        2. communicate whats at stake
        3. be stated as complete sentence
    (Ex):
        wrong: "the fate of the oceans"
        correct: "worldwide pollution is killing the ocean and us"

What TYPE of visualization to use:
- has to convey your message
- Declarative or Explanatory are most common

bottom left quadrant:
- Conceptual/ Exploratory
- Idea Genderation
    - setting: brainstormming, working session
    - begginings of idea illustration
    - data types: messy, undefined

top left quadrant:
- Conceptual/ Declarative
- Idea illustration
    - setting: presentation, teaching
    - easy to explain a concept or process
    - visual type: simple
    - goal: learning

bottom right corner
- Data Driven/ Exploratory
- Visual Discovery
    - show your teammates/coworker
    - visual type: very advanced
    - setting: working session, not a presentation
    - data type: big data
    - goals: show trends

Top right corner
- Data Driven/ Declarative
- Everyday visualization
    - data type: simple
    - setting: formal, presentation
    - visual type: chart, static

STEPS TO CREATE YOUR CHARTS:
PART 2-4:

2. Talk and Listen
- Concepts: 
    - when you explain, you'll understand it better
    - take notes and pay attention to keywords as clues to charttypes
- Headspace: 
    - youll feel nervous. practice
    - be attentive to keywords 
- Artifacts:
    - notes capturing keywords
    - questions that need to be answered
    - identify gaps in thinking or knowledge 
        - someone doesnt understand what you explined, how can you explain better

3. Sketch
- Concepts: 
    - match keyword from step 2
    - sketch ideas for charts that represent what you want to show (goodnotes.com or plotly.com)
        - do NOT just go to tableau- use your sketch first
- Headspace: 
    - stay creative, open-minded
    - don't worry about details or ideas
- Artifacts:
    - quick, messy sketches incase you ahve to scrap it and restart
    - a rough draft


4. Prototype
- Concepts: 
    - define your rough draft- titles, figures, colors, etc
    - second and third draft (until correct)
- Headspace: 
    - focus on details
    - confortable with you big IDEA
- Artifacts:
    - confirm chart on paper
    - a map to guide you in Tableu, plotly, etc
